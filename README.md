# BackCAPS Logistics
Revolutionizing the delivery operations

## Introduction
   The transportation industry, especially the movement of goods via Heavy Transport Vehicles
   (HTVs) also known as Logistic system, constitutes a vital sector in any country's economic
   framework. Efficient and organized transportation of goods is fundamental for economic
   growth and development within the region. It streamlines the logistic operations to help large
   organizations as well as startups to grow quickly also making it easy for the customers to send
   and receive products. However, the current economic crisis of 2023 in Pakistan has drastically
   affected businesses across the country. An improved system should be established, in which,
   the existing systems faced significant challenges that impede seamless logistic operations
   including a lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly online booking system, inefficient route
   planning, inadequate load matching, limited transparency, registration of small businesses, and
   cumbersome paperwork. 
## Project Introduction
   The BackCAPS Logistics will allow users to register their business on the platform and operate
   it smoothly including, order processing, packaging control, route guidance system having
   advanced tracking system to save time, money, and fuel. It will help companies look for new
   drivers from the Driver Resource Center. It also allows the customers to send and receive goods
   across the country. A list of open-to-work drivers having no cargo utility vehicle will be shown
   to companies registered on the platform, from where the companies could hire them, which
   will eventually create new job opportunities. A person can also register his cargo vehicle along
   with driving license to work locally on the platform. Upon receiving an order, the platform will
   prioritize the order to be delivered by the registered organization, if the registered organization
   declines the order processing then the order will be handed over to registered local drivers.
   This platform will be beneficial for large organizations as well as individuals. The organization
   will be able to register its business on it to manage logistic operations. It will also be able to
   hire drivers from the Driver Resource Center within the platform where the list of open-to-
   work drivers is maintained. It will also ease the process of delivering goods across the country
   for the customers.
