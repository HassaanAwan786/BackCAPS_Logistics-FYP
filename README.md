# BackCAPS Logistics
Revolutionizing the delivery operations

## Introduction
   The transportation industry, especially the movement of goods via Heavy Transport Vehicles
   (HTVs) also known as Logistic system, constitutes a vital sector in any country's economic
   framework. Efficient and organized transportation of goods is fundamental for economic
   growth and development within the region. It streamlines the logistic operations to help large
   organizations as well as startups to grow quickly also making it easy for the customers to send
   and receive products. However, the current economic crisis of 2023 in Pakistan has drastically
   affected businesses across the country. An improved system should be established, in which,
   the existing systems faced significant challenges that impede seamless logistic operations
   including a lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly online booking system, inefficient route
   planning, inadequate load matching, limited transparency, registration of small businesses, and
   cumbersome paperwork. 

## Project Overview
BackCAPS Logistics is a mobile application prototype designed to digitize and optimize operations for small-to-medium logistics fleets. The project addresses real-world inefficiencies observed in manual dispatch, low vehicle utilization, and lack of data-driven decision-making in the local logistics sector.

The app connects vehicle owners with customers needing goods transportation, providing a centralized platform for booking, tracking, and managing logistics workflows.

## Technical Implementation
- **System Architecture and design** : 3 layer Architecture.
- **Frontend:** Built with **Flutter** (Dart) for cross-platform mobile compatibility.
- **Backend & Database:** **Google Firebase** (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Storage) for real-time data synchronization and user management.
- **Core Services:** Integrated **Google Maps API** for location pick-up/drop-off selection, geocoding, and distance calculation.
- **State Management:** Provider pattern for efficient app state management.
- **Development Tools:** Android Studio, VS Code, Git/GitHub for version control.

## System Architecture & My Contributions
As a core member of a 3-person team, my primary responsibilities focused on **system architecture and Designt**:
Led the system design phase for BackCAPS Logistics, a multi-platform logistics platform. Developed comprehensive UML diagrams (use cases, sequence, activity, class, architecture) and UI prototypes to define system behavior, structure, and user interaction. My design work established the foundation for implementation, ensuring alignment with functional requirements and scalability.
